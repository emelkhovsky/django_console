### django_console
It was created for learning linux commands.

This website consists of 6 lessons, each of which describes a certain type of commands: 
- commands for managing files
- commands for navigating in the terminal
- commands for managing processes, network and users
- commands for working with text 
- commands for the user's environment

Every lesson has tasks that you can execute using the built-in console.

Web-site uses:
- ***Django***(python)
- ***Paramiko***(python) for ssh connection
- ***javascript***
- ***ajax*** for console updating
- ***css***
- ***html***
- ***jinja2***(templates)

If you don't have an account yet you need to register.

There will be a window in front of you where you need to fill your personal data: login, password and e-mail. 
You will not be able to access lessons without logging into your account. 
The application supports a session, so if you left the site and log in again, re-authorization is not required.

It contains an introduction to lessons:

Each lesson asks you to practice and enter some commands into the console. 
The command line has a field for entering, you press the send button and the result of the command will be displayed on the screen. 
In order to flip through the output use the slider to the left of the console.

If you entered a command that does not exist, you will see the text message "Command not found".

Also there are some commands that I am only introducing, they are important, but do not work, because they
may affect the console work and system. When such commands are entered, there will be the text message â€œCommand is not
allowed, sorry ".

At the end of the first lesson, you will be asked to complete the lesson. It will take you on the next lesson page.
Alternatively, you can proceed to the next lesson by selecting it from the menu on the left. 
I advise you to go through all the lessons in order.

On progress page you can see the rating of the first 3 users who scored more points, 
that's why you will be motivated to do better. Besides, it is described in detail for what points are credited or deducted.
Also in the window "Your progress" you can track your progress, number of passed lessons, 
percentage of correct answers and percentage of course completion.
